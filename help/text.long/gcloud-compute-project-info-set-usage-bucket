NAME
       gcloud-compute-project-info-set-usage-bucket - Set the usage reporting
       bucket for a project

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute project-info set-usage-bucket
         --bucket [BUCKET]
         [--help]
         [--prefix PREFIX]
         [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute project-info set-usage-bucket is used to configure usage
       reporting for projects.

       Setting usage reporting will cause a log of usage per resource to be
       written to a specified Google Cloud Storage bucket daily. For example,

           $ gcloud compute project-info set-usage-bucket \
               --bucket gs://my-bucket

       will cause logs of the form usage_gce_YYYYMMDD.csv to be written daily
       to the bucket "my-bucket". To disable this feature, issue the command:

           $ gcloud compute project-info set-usage-bucket --clear

FLAGS
       --bucket [BUCKET]
           The URI of a Google Cloud Storage bucket where the usage report
           object should be stored. The Google Service Account for performing
           usage reporting is granted write access to this bucket. The user
           running this command must be an owner of the bucket.

           To clear the usage bucket, specify this flag without an argument:

               $ gcloud compute project-info set-usage-bucket --bucket

       --help
           Display detailed help.

       --prefix PREFIX
           An optional prefix for the name of the usage report object stored
           in the bucket. If not supplied, then this defaults to "usage_". The
           report is stored as a CSV file named PREFIX_gce_YYYYMMDD.csv where
           YYYYMMDD is the day of the usage according to Pacific Time. The
           prefix should conform to Google Cloud Storage object naming
           conventions. This flag must not be provided if "--clear" is
           provided.

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.
