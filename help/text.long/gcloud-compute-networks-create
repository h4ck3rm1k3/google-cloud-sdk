NAME
       gcloud-compute-networks-create - Create a Google Compute Engine network

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute networks create
         NAME
         [--description DESCRIPTION]
         [--help]
         [--range RANGE; default="10.0.0.0/8"]
         [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute networks create is used to create virtual networks. A
       network performs the same function that a router does in a home
       network: it describes the network range and gateway IP address, handles
       communication between instances, and serves as a gateway between
       instances and callers outside the network.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the network.

FLAGS
       --description DESCRIPTION
           An optional, textual description for the network.

       --help
           Display detailed help.

       --range RANGE
           Specifies the IPv4 address range of this network. The range must be
           specified in CIDR format:
           http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing. If
           omitted, 10.0.0.0/8 is used.

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.
