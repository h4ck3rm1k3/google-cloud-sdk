NAME
       gcloud-components-restore - This is an undo operation, which restores
       the Cloud SDK installation on the local workstation to the state it was
       in just before the most recent `[gcloud components] update` or `[gcloud
       components] remove` command. Only the state before the most recent such
       state is remembered, so it is impossible to restore the state that
       existed before the two most recent `update` commands, for example. A
       `restore` command does not undo a previous `restore` command.
