       gcloud compute ssh

         [--zone ZONE]
         [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute ssh is a thin wrapper around the ssh(1) command that
       takes care of authentication and the translation of the instance name
       into an IP address.

       This command ensures that the user's public SSH key is present in the
       project's metadata. If the user does not have a public SSH key, one is
       generated using ssh-keygen(1).

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       [USER@]INSTANCE
           Specifies the instance to SSH into. If "INSTANCE" is the name of
           the instance, the "--zone" flag must be specified. If "INSTANCE" is
           a suffix of the instance's URI that contains the zone (e.g.,
           "us-central2-a/instances/my-instance"), then "--zone" can be
           omitted.

           "USER" specifies the username with which to SSH. If omitted, $USER
           from the environment is selected.

FLAGS
       --command COMMAND
           A command to run on the virtual machine.

       --container CONTAINER
           The name of a container inside of the virtual machine instance to
           connect to. This only applies to virtual machines that are using a
           Google container virtual machine image. For more information, see
           https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/containers.

       --dry-run
           If provided, prints the command that would be run to standard out
           instead of executing it.

       --help
           Display detailed help.

       --plain
           Suppresses the automatic addition of ssh(1)/scp(1) flags. This flag
           is useful if you want to take care of authentication yourself or
           re-enable strict host checking.

       --ssh-flag SSH_FLAG
           Additional flags to be passed to ssh(1). It is recommended that
           flags be passed using an assignment operator and quotes. This flag
           will replace occurences of "%USER%" and "%INSTANCE%" with their
           dereferenced values. Example:

               $ gcloud compute ssh my-instance --zone us-central1-a \
                   --ssh-flag="-vvv" --ssh-flag="-L 80:%INSTANCE%:80"

           is equivalent to passing the flags "--vvv" and "-L
           80:162.222.181.197:80" to ssh(1) if the external IP address of
           "my-instance" is 162.222.181.197.

       --ssh-key-file SSH_KEY_FILE
           The path to the SSH key file. By deault, this is
           "~/.ssh/google_compute_engine".

       --zone ZONE
           The zone of the instance to connect to. If omitted and the
           arguments are not all URIs, you will be prompted to select a zone.

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES
       To SSH into "my-instance" in zone "us-central2-a", run:

           $ gcloud compute ssh my-instance --zone us-central2-a

       You can omit the "--zone" flag if the zone is provided in the
       positional argument:

           $ gcloud compute ssh us-central2-a/instances/my-instance

       You can also run a command on the virtual machine. For example, to get
       a snapshot of the guest's process tree, run:

           $ gcloud compute ssh my-instance --zone us-central2-a --command "ps -ejH"

       If you are using the Google container virtual machine image, you can
       SSH into one of your containers with:

           $ gcloud compute ssh my-instance \
               --zone us-central2-a \
               --container my-container
