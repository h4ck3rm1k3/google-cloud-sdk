DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute instances add-access-config is used to create access
       configurations for network interfaces of Google Compute Engine virtual
       machines.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the instance to add the access configuration to.

FLAGS
       --access-config-name ACCESS_CONFIG_NAME
           Specifies the name of the new access configuration. "external-nat"
           is used as the default if this flag is not provided.

       --address ADDRESS
           Specifies the external IP address of the new access configuration.
           If this is not specified, then the service will choose an available
           ephemeral IP address. If an explicit IP address is given, then that
           IP address must be reserved by the project and not be in use by
           another resource.

       --help
           Display detailed help.

       --network-interface NETWORK_INTERFACE
           Specifies the name of the network interface on which to add the new
           access configuration. If this is not provided, then "nic0" is used
           as the default.

       --zone ZONE
           The zone of the instance to add an access config to. If omitted and
           the arguments are not all URIs, you will be prompted to select a
           zone.

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.
