       gcloud-compute-images-create - Create Google Compute Engine images

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute images create
         NAME
         [--description DESCRIPTION]
         [--help]

         [--source-disk SOURCE_DISK | --source-uri SOURCE_URI]
         [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute images create is used to create custom disk images. The
       resulting image can be provided during instance or disk creation so
       that the instance attached to the resulting disks has access to a known
       set of software or files from the image.

       Images can be created from gzipped compressed tarball containing raw
       disk data or from existing disks in any zone.

       Images are global resources, so they can be used across zones and
       projects.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the image to create.

FLAGS

       --help
           Display detailed help.

       --source-disk SOURCE_DISK
           A source disk to create the image from. The value for this option
           can be the name of a disk with the zone specified via
           "--source-disk-zone" flag.

           This flag is mutually exclusive with "--source-uri".

       --source-disk-zone SOURCE_DISK_ZONE
           The zone of the disk specified by --source-disk. If omitted and the
           arguments are not all URIs, you will be prompted to select a zone.

       --source-uri SOURCE_URI
           The full Google Cloud Storage URI where the disk image is stored.
           This file must be a gzip-compressed tarball whose name ends in
           ".tar.gz".

           This flag is mutually exclusive with "--source-disk".

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.
