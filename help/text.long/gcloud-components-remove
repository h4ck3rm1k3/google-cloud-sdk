       gcloud-components-remove - Uninstall all listed components, as well as
       all components that directly or indirectly depend on them.

DESCRIPTION
       Uninstall all listed components, as well as all components that
       directly or indirectly depend on them. For example, if the component
       unicorn-factory depends on the component horn-factory, removing
       horn-factory will cause unicorn-factory to be removed as well. The
       command lists all components it is about to remove, and asks for
       confirmation before proceeding.
