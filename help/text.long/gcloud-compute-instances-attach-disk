SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute instances attach-disk
         INSTANCE
         [--device-name DEVICE_NAME]
         --disk DISK

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute instances attach-disk is used to attach a disk to an
       instance. For example,

           $ compute instances attach-disk my-instance --disk my-disk
             --zone us-central1-a

       attaches the disk named "my-disk" to the instance named "my-instance"
       in zone "us-central1-a".

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       INSTANCE
           The name of the instance to attach the disk to.

FLAGS
       --device-name DEVICE_NAME
           An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
           system will see.

       --disk DISK
           The name of the disk to attach to the instance.

       --help

       --mode MODE
           Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are "ro" for
           read-only and "rw" for read-write. If omitted, "rw" is used as a

           than one instance.

       --zone ZONE
