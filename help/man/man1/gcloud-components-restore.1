.SH "NAME"
gcloud-components-restore \- This is an undo operation, which restores the Cloud SDK installation on the local workstation to the state it was in just before the most recent `[gcloud components] update` or `[gcloud components] remove` command\&. Only the state before the most recent such state is remembered, so it is impossible to restore the state that existed before the two most recent `update` commands, for example\&. A `restore` command does not undo a previous `restore` command\&.
