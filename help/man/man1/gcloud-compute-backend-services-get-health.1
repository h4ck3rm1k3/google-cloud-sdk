.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBgcloud compute backend\-services get\-health\fR is used to request the current health status of instances in a backend service\&. Every group in the service is checked and the health status of each configured instance is printed\&.
.sp
If a group contains names of instance that don\(cqt exist or instances that haven\(cqt yet been pushed to the load\-balancing system, they will not show up\&. Those that are listed as \(lqHEALTHY\(rq are able to receive load\-balanced traffic\&. Those that are marked as \(lqUNHEALTHY\(rq are either failing the configured health\-check or not responding to it\&.
.sp
Since the health checks are performed continuously and in a distributed manner, the state returned by this command is the most recent result of a vote of several redundant health checks\&. Backend services that do not have a valid global forwarding rule referencing it will not be health checked and so will have no health status\&.
