.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBgcloud compute ssh\fR is a thin wrapper around the \fBssh(1)\fR command that takes care of authentication and the translation of the instance name into an IP address\&.
.sp
This command ensures that the user\(cqs public SSH key is present in the project\(cqs metadata\&. If the user does not have a public SSH key, one is generated using \fBssh\-keygen(1)\fR\&.
.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"
.PP
\fI[USER@]INSTANCE\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the instance to SSH into\&. If \(lqINSTANCE\(rq is the name of the instance, the \(lq\-\-zone\(rq flag must be specified\&. If \(lqINSTANCE\(rq is a suffix of the instance\(cqs URI that contains the zone (e\&.g\&., \(lqus\-central2\-a/instances/my\-instance\(rq), then \(lq\-\-zone\(rq can be omitted\&.
.sp
\(lqUSER\(rq specifies the username with which to SSH\&. If omitted, $USER from the environment is selected\&.
.RE
.SH "FLAGS"
.PP
\fB\-\-command\fR \fICOMMAND\fR
.RS 4
A command to run on the virtual machine\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-container\fR \fICONTAINER\fR
.RS 4
The name of a container inside of the virtual machine instance to connect to\&. This only applies to virtual machines that are using a Google container virtual machine image\&. For more information, see
https://developers\&.google\&.com/compute/docs/containers\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR
.RS 4
If provided, prints the command that would be run to standard out instead of executing it\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Display detailed help\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-plain\fR
.RS 4
Suppresses the automatic addition of
\fBssh(1)\fR/\fBscp(1)\fR
flags\&. This flag is useful if you want to take care of authentication yourself or re\-enable strict host checking\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ssh\-flag\fR \fISSH_FLAG\fR
.RS 4
Additional flags to be passed to
\fBssh(1)\fR\&. It is recommended that flags be passed using an assignment operator and quotes\&. This flag will replace occurences of \(lq%USER%\(rq and \(lq%INSTANCE%\(rq with their dereferenced values\&. Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ gcloud compute ssh my\-instance \-\-zone us\-central1\-a \e
    \-\-ssh\-flag="\-vvv" \-\-ssh\-flag="\-L 80:%INSTANCE%:80"
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
is equivalent to passing the flags \(lq\-\-vvv\(rq and \(lq\-L 80:162\&.222\&.181\&.197:80\(rq to
\fBssh(1)\fR
if the external IP address of \(lqmy\-instance\(rq is 162\&.222\&.181\&.197\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ssh\-key\-file\fR \fISSH_KEY_FILE\fR
.RS 4
The path to the SSH key file\&. By deault, this is \(lq~/\&.ssh/google_compute_engine\(rq\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-zone\fR \fIZONE\fR
.RS 4
The zone of the instance to connect to\&. If omitted and the arguments are not all URIs, you will be prompted to select a zone\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-h\fR
.RS 4
Print a summary help and exit\&.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To SSH into \(lqmy\-instance\(rq in zone \(lqus\-central2\-a\(rq, run:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ gcloud compute ssh my\-instance \-\-zone us\-central2\-a
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
You can omit the \(lq\-\-zone\(rq flag if the zone is provided in the positional argument:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ gcloud compute ssh us\-central2\-a/instances/my\-instance
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
You can also run a command on the virtual machine\&. For example, to get a snapshot of the guest\(cqs process tree, run:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ gcloud compute ssh my\-instance \-\-zone us\-central2\-a \-\-command "ps \-ejH"
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If you are using the Google container virtual machine image, you can SSH into one of your containers with:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ gcloud compute ssh my\-instance \e
    \-\-zone us\-central2\-a \e
    \-\-container my\-container
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
