.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBgcloud compute images create\fR is used to create custom disk images\&. The resulting image can be provided during instance or disk creation so that the instance attached to the resulting disks has access to a known set of software or files from the image\&.
.sp
Images can be created from gzipped compressed tarball containing raw disk data or from existing disks in any zone\&.
.sp
Images are global resources, so they can be used across zones and projects\&.
